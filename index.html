				<h3> Modem </h3>
				<p> Short for modulator-demodulator. A modem is a device that enables a computer to transmit data over, for example, telephone or cable lines. Computer information is stored digitally, whereas information transmitted over telephone lines is transmitted in the form of analog waves. A modem converts between these two forms. </p>

				<h3> Router </h3>
				<p> A wireless router is a device in a wireless local area network (WLAN) that determines the next network point to which a packet should be forwarded toward its destination. A wireless router usually connects to a modem, and creates a WiFi signal in order to forward the internet information converted with the modem to WiFi enabled devices. </p>

				<h3> Ethernet </h3>
				<p> An Ethernet cable is one of the most common forms of network cable used on wired networks. Ethernet cables connect devices within a local area network, like PCs, routers, and switches. It is commonly used as the bridging cable between a modem and wireless router, and can also be used to connect a computer directly to a router for faster access to the internet. </p>
